return statement is a function that return a value. simply, return statement doesn't have a value. but, it produces (return) a value. for some simple case, it helps with calculation.

so everytime the function is called, the value will be sent to return statement, and return statement will return the value to where the function is called.

(i hope this is correct :D)
